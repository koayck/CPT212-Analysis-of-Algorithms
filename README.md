# CPT212-Analysis-of-Algorithms 

## Introduction
This repository contains our implementation and analysis of two multiplication algorithms: the Simple Multiplication Algorithm and the Karatsuba Algorithm. We have implemented these algorithms in Java, inserted counters to count the primitive operations, and plotted graphs to compare their time complexities.

    ```cd CPT212-Analysis-of-Algorithms```

3. Run the `Main.java` file to execute the program.

## Project Details
### Part 1: Simple Multiplication Algorithm
We have implemented the Simple Multiplication Algorithm as described in the assignment. The algorithm multiplies each digit in the multiplicand by each digit of the multiplier, keeps the partial product and carriers if there is any, and adds up all the properly shifted partial products and carriers.

### Part 2: Karatsuba Algorithm
We have also implemented the Karatsuba Algorithm, a fast multiplication algorithm that uses divide and conquer strategy. We have inserted counters at appropriate locations in the program to count the primitive operations executed by the Karatsuba algorithm.

## Results and Discussion
We have plotted graphs showing the number of operations versus the number of digits (n) for both algorithms. We have compared and discussed the results obtained in the experiment and the time complexity of the theoretical analysis. We have also compared the time complexity of the Simple Multiplication Algorithm versus the Karatsuba Algorithm based on the experiment results.
